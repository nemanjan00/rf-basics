# RF 101 - from Hz, to GHz in 1h

## Who am I?

* Hacker

* I am addicted to cool hobies

* No formal education in RF

* I learn by doing

* I may be wrong, so, make sure to correct me, so we both learn

* My employer does not care if my opinion is considered to reflect theirs

## Oscillation

* Constant

* Sinewave

## Resonance

* Capacitance

    * Reservoir and water that changes flow speed

* Inductance

    * Heavy pendulum and inertia

* Capacitance and inductance cancel each other out and we get resonance

* Antenna "likes" to *transmit* and *receive* energy of that frequency

## Frequency and wavelength

* Frequency is how many times per second oscillation happens (Hz)

* Wavelength is how much wave travels during second (m)

## Filtering

* You can extract that oscillation from sum of a lot of oscillations

## Mixing

* You can shift around that oscillation to other frequencies
