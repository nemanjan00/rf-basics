# RF 101 - from Hz, to GHz in 1h

 * I solemnly swear I am up to no good
 
 * This will be your marauders map for your way around RF

## We are all hackers

 * My vision of learning

    * Play with it

    * Understand it

    * Modify it/shape it into what is useful

    * (Usually break something)

    * Repeat

 * What this is not:

    * College lecture

    * A lot of you probably know RF a lot better than me

 * What it is

    * Intuition is our best friend - so lets develop it

    * Starting point for future learning

## Why do you have potions making kit in front of you?

 * I will be using mix of modern tools and oldschools pysics tools like tuning forks

 * This will be very much practical talk

 * I will try to make as cheap as possible to replicate it home

## Let them hippogriff wings oscillate

Time to take off... 

If I had to define single thing as building block of RF, it would be oscillation

But, what the fuck is that, what it is for and why does it not work?

You can think of anything that is periodically repeating as oscillation...

 * Seasons are for example oscillation

 * Your heartbeat

 * Seconds ticking

It is important to think of oscillation as something abstract

## That hippogriff is crazy fast, he is flapping his wings 3 times a second

How many times a second does oscillation happen?

 * Once - Hz

 * Thousand of times - kHz

 * Million times - MHz

...

So, he is flapping them wings at 3Hz...
