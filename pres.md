# RF 101 - from Hz, to GHz in 1h

I was told RF is magic, so I decided to really make it into magic

 * I solemnly swear I am up to no good
 
 * This will be your marauders map for your way around RF

## We are all hackers

 * My vision of learning

    * Play with it

    * Understand it

    * Modify it/shape it into what is useful

    * (Usually break something)

    * Repeat

 * What this is not:

    * College lecture

    * A lot of you probably know RF a lot better than me

    * I will not talk much about RF, but you will see why later

 * What it is

    * Intuition is our best friend - so lets develop it

    * Starting point for future learning

    * You might not be able to understand rubber duck after this, but, you will be pwning them conspiracy theory muggles

## Why do you have potions making kit in front of you?

 * I will be using mix of modern tools and oldschools pysics tools like tuning forks

 * This will be very much practical talk

 * I will try to make as cheap as possible to replicate it home

## Let them hippogriff wings oscillate

Time to take off... 

If I had to define single thing as building block of RF, it would be oscillation

But, what the fuck is that, what it is for and why does it not work?

You can think of anything that is periodically repeating as oscillation...

 * Seasons are for example oscillation

 * Your heartbeat

 * Seconds ticking

It is important to think of oscillation as something abstract

## That hippogriff is crazy fast, he is flapping his wings 3 times a second

How many times a second does oscillation happen?

 * Once - Hz

 * Thousand of times - kHz

 * Million times - MHz

...

So, he is flapping them wings at 3Hz...

(I will clap at certain rate, to show the frequency)

## That quidditch start whistle frequency made my butterbeer glass break

I used to know what resonance was, but I drank too much butterbeer.

I will hit these tuning forks a bit, maybe it will wake me up... 

Wait, I hit just one, why is other one shaking too?

Resonance: 

 * Object *likes to oscillate* at certain frequency

    * Takes maximum of energy in that frequency

    * Transmits maximum of energy at that frequency

(I will be using 2 tuning forks, to show off resonance)

## She is shaking that wand just the right way, it is releasing so much power (ðŸ‘¼)

If you introduce oscillation in object at the frequency it is resonant at, it will release that oscillation into the air... 

If there are oscillations in the air around at resonant frequencies, they will be picked up by resonant object...

(I will use tuning fork and signal generator connected to the speaker, to demonstrate resonance at specific frequency, I will be changing frequency)

## Hagrid clapped my back so hard I almost fell off the chair

Amplitude is how hard something is oscillating...

(I will demonstrate amplitude with how hard I hit tuning forks, the harder I hit them, the harder other one oscillates)

## My friends really likes Hermione, but we are at Snapes class, how do we send her the message?

We are crap at charms so we can not send her flying note, but we are plenty good at hitting our cauldrons using our wands, at their resonant frequency, and she has the same model... It was on discount... 
So, we want to encode data, but, how?

I can slightly alter frequency - FM - Frequency modulation

I can alternate harder and softer hits - AM - Amplitude modulation

...

And I can use that thing muggles use morse?

## Someones frog ate my morse code book

Perhaps I could modulate analog signal?

Like my voice?

What if I hit it super fast and change amplitude based off amplitude of my voice?

## Hermione was so confused by random clapping that she put her unicorn horn into cauldron too early

Now, she is starting to notice soft voice coming out of her cauldron... 

Maybe she can amplify it? 

She grabs glass from nearby, connects it to her cauldron and starts demodulating AM, listening to my friend...
